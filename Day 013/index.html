    <!-- HTML entities are a crucial part of HTML markup language. They enable you to display characters that are reserved in HTML or that aren't readily available on the keyboard. -->

    <!-- HTML entities are used to represent special characters in a format that the browser can understand. They start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;) -->

    <!-- Here are some reasons:

    Reserved Characters: Characters like <,>, and & are reserved in HTML.
    Special Symbols: For symbols like ©, ®, or mathematical symbols.
    Non-Breaking Spaces: To create white spaces that won't break into a new line. -->

    <!-- &lt;  for <
        &gt;  for >
        &amp; for &
        &nbsp; for a non-breaking space
        &copy; for © -->

    <h2>HTML Quotation Tag</h2>
    </p>
    <!-- The use of quotations is common in textual content. HTML provides specific tags to handle this: <blockquote> for block quotations and <q> for inline quotations -->

    <!-- The <blockquote> and <q> tags serve to define quotations in HTML. While <blockquote> is used for longer, block-level quotes, <q> is used for shorter, inline quotes -->

    <!-- cite: Specifies the URL of the quote's source -->

    <blockquote cite="source-url">
        Quotation text here.
    </blockquote>

    <q cite="source-url">Quotation text here.</q>

    <!-- The <code> tag is a semantic HTML tag that's used for displaying code snippets. It can be used both inline and within a block-level element like <pre></pre> -->
